<p>When I started doing CSS, and coolly switching background-colors with a word or two, I was horrified to discover that layouts are so difficult.</p>

<p>After all, I thought, <strong>layouts were the whole damn point of CSS</strong> in the first place. Well, turns out they’re a lot easier now than they were 10 years ago. But even then, they’re not that easy.</p>

<p>It’s why people use<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/"> bootstrap css</a> all the time. It just puts shit in the centre of the page and lines it up nicely. And god knows it’s kind of a faff doing it any other way.</p>

Turning a UL element into a navigation bar requires more heavy-lifting in CSS than you would hope</em></p>

<p> </p>

<p>One of the tasks I set myself on github was to create the “holy grail” of web design - a responsive three column layout with a navigation bar at the top. But I decided to do it three times over.</p>
<h2 id="once-with-float-and-blockinline-block-properties">1. Once with ‘float’ and ‘block/inline-block’ properties</h2>

<p><a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ajwl/holy-grail-3-ways/blob/master/float/float.html"> » View Float Website</a>This is the classic way of doing CSS layout right now, it’s widely-supported and responsive. Just about.</p>
<h2 id="a-second-time-with-flexbox">2. A second time with flexbox</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">Flexbox spec is described here on MDN</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-third-time-with-grid">3. A third time with grid</h2>

<p>Grid is an experimental CSS property that, yes produces grids. Nice flexible grids, with hardly any code needed at all. I really like this one.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid"> Grid is described here on MDN.</a></p>

<p>To view this site you need to go into Chrome or whichever browser you are using and enable experimental features: Paste <em>chrome://flags</em> into the URL bar and scroll down to the option to Enable experimental Web Platform features.</p>

<p>I also delve into some fun CSS transitions and transforms because why the hell not. I really like skew.</p>
