<p>A <a href="http://soundcite.knightlab.com/#create-new">javascript tool</a> that 
lets you put a soundclip behind a word. Like a animated gif of sound, 
worked into the story. Not sure how useful it will but it certainly makes it all more lively.</p>

<p>Let’s take… a lyric from a Childish Gambino song that I like because 
it references social media: “Come back to me like hipsters to blogspot”</p>

<p>And it works… that was good.</p>

<p>One more social media reference from the same great song: “Read your 
twitter messages, too proud to block you”</p>

<p>Good for texture and punchlines.</p>
