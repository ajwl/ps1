<p>I like this definition of “television” from the Oxford English Dictionary, quoted on <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television">etymonline</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1907: the action of seeing by means of Hertzian waves or otherwise, what is existing or happening at a place concealed or distant from the observer’s eyes [OED]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It makes it sound more mystical. Compared to how we currently think about it anyway.</p>

<p>Tele - comes from the Greek meaning ”far off, afar, at or to a distance”.</p>
