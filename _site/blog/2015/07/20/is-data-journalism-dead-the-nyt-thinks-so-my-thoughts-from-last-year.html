<p>I was interested to see that The New York Times’ data journalism blog the Upshot recently published a piece called ‘<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/upshot/death-to-data-journalism.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0">Death to Data Journalism</a>’. This is a key sentence:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>You’ll notice that at least a couple of us find the phrase “data journalism” to be a bit strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Data journalism, ultimately, has the same aim as “quote journalism” and “anecdote journalism.” They all aspire to be “fact journalism” or, more eloquently, journalism.</p>

<p>So regardless of the source - journalism is journalism. It’s what I said in <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/the-tricky-line-in-tabloid-data-journalism-lessons-from-one-year-of-ampp3d/s2/a563530/">this interview I did with journalism.co.uk</a> about Ampp3d, the data journalism site for the Mirror that I edited.</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>Editor Anna Leach told Journalism.co.uk that after a year of working on Ampp3d, she sees data and numbers as just another source for news stories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I don’t think there is something that intrinsically different in data journalism from ‘normal’ journalism and I think it’s a little bit set to one side,” she said.</p>

<p>“A number is evidence in the same way a quotation is.”</p>

<p>The dichotomy between data journalism and normal journalism is false in many ways. The division probably reflects different skill sets within the newsroom rather than qualitatively different stories.</p>
