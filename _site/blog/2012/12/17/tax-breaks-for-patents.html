<p>Found this initiative interesting. Story is from a while ago, but law will be coming into force from April 2013.</p>

<p>Profits directly attributable to patents owned or wholly-licensed by a business will be taxed at 10% not 23% - the new corporation tax rate.</p>

<p>So patent anything you damn well can.</p>
