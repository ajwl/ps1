Interesting story on the guardian about how our internal means of measuring time - heartbeats, breaths - calibrate with how the clock measures time. When our internal systems speed up, for example when heartrate jumps if you're afraid, then you perceive that a Â longer time passes compared to straightforward clock time. eg if 70 hearbeats a minute is normal, and then your heart speeds up to 90/100, it feels like a longer time has passed going by your internal clock. That's why time appears to slow down when we're afraid. LOVE IT.
