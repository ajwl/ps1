    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a developer at <a href="http://www.zopa.com" target="_blank">Zopa</a>, a peer-to-peer lending platform. I work with Ruby, Javascript and HTML/CSS to take data from APIs right up to the user interface.
      My Ruby expertise includes integrating internal and external APIs, writing a private gem, & working with Rails and Sinatra. I keep the code tested with Rspec and Cucumber.
      On the front-end, I make mobile-optimized web pages with the latest CSS and semantic HTML,  using Javascript to create user interactions and work with UX to make prototypes and implement multipage AB tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before becoming a developer I managed a section of a national news site for a year, as the editor of <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/">Ampp3d</a>, a multimedia data site that was part of the Mirror. This is what I learned there. I ran a team of 5 writers, graphicists and a developer to pull off scoops, produce visual tabloid-friendly data journalism and several kooky javascript widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013-14 I worked as an online reporter / producer at <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/anna-leach">Channel 4 News</a>. There, I wrote for FactCheck, the Orwell-prize winning blog on topics such as Does putting cameras on cops make them behave better? and Are 20 per cent of London marriages bogus? and covered a whole range of news stories. A short documentary about a gay bar in Troubles-racked Northern Ireland that I co-directed made it onto the site. The documentary has received further funding for a longer cut from Channel 4’s short film strand – Shooting Gallery – for young directing talent.

    <p>
      I was previously a technology reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and worked for 2 years on the Register scooping the tech problems behind the RBS/Natwest banking software glitch that affected 17 million people
