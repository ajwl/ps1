    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Client-side Developer at the Guardian.
    <p>
      I have worked as an Interactives Developer at the <a href="https://www.ft.com/anna-leach">F.T.</a>,
      building data visualisations, calculators, bots, scrapers and self-updating graphics with Node.js and d3.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my first dev job I worked at <a href="http://www.zopa.com" target="_blank">Zopa</a>, a peer-to-peer lending platform.
      where I worked with Ruby, Javascript and HTML/CSS.
      I integrated internal and external APIs, wrote a private gem, & worked with Rails and
      Sinatra and built several new user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before becoming a developer I managed a section of a national news site for a year, as the editor of
      <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/">Ampp3d</a>, a multimedia data site that was part of the Mirror.
      <a href="/blog/9-things-i-learned-from-trying-to-do-mainstream-data-journalism.html">This is what I learned there</a>. I ran a team of 5 writers, graphicists and a developer to pull off scoops, produce
      visual tabloid-friendly data journalism and several kooky javascript widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013-14 I worked as an online reporter / producer at <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/anna-leach">Channel 4 News</a>.
      I wrote a bunch of news stories and made a short documentary about a gay bar bridging the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was previously a technology reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and worked for 2 years on the Register
      scooping the tech problems behind the RBS/Natwest banking software glitch that affected 17 million people.
