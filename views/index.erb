    <h2>BIO</h2>
    <p>
      I am a developer at the Guardian working with Javascript and Scala.
    <p>
      I previously worked as an Interactives Developer at the <a href="https://www.ft.com/anna-leach" target="_blank">F.T.</a>,
      building data visualisations, calculators, bots, scrapers and self-updating graphics with Node.js and d3.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my first dev job I worked at <a href="http://www.zopa.com" target="_blank">Zopa</a>, a peer-to-peer lending platform,
      where I worked with Ruby, Javascript and HTML/CSS.
      I integrated internal and external APIs, wrote a private gem, & worked with Rails and
      Sinatra and built several new user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before becoming a developer I was a journalist: the editor of
      <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/" target="_blank">Ampp3d</a>, a multimedia data site that was part of the Mirror.
      <a href="/blog/9-things-i-learned-from-trying-to-do-mainstream-data-journalism.html" target="_blank">This is what I learned there</a>. I managed a team of 5 writers, graphicists and a developer to pull off scoops, produce
      visual tabloid-friendly data journalism and several kooky javascript widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013-14 I worked as an online reporter / producer at <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/anna-leach" target="_blank">Channel 4 News</a>.
      I wrote a bunch of news stories and made a short documentary about a
      <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-only-gay-bar-in-the-village" target="_blank">gay bar bridging the 
      sectarian divide in Northern Ireland. 
      This is my <a href="http://sexynorthernirishprods.tumblr.com/">other contribution to the Northern Irish peace process.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I was previously a technology reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the Register.
