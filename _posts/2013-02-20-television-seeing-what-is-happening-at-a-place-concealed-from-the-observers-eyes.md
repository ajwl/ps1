I like this definition of "television" from the Oxford English Dictionary, quoted on [etymonline](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=television).

> 1907: the action of seeing by means of Hertzian waves or otherwise, what is existing or happening at a place concealed or distant from the observer's eyes [OED]

It makes it sound more mystical. Compared to how we currently think about it anyway.

Tele - comes from the Greek meaningÂ "far off, afar, at or to a distance".
