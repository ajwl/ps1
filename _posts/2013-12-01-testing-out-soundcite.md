A [javascript tool](http://soundcite.knightlab.com/#create-new) that 
lets you put a soundclip behind a word. Like a animated gif of sound, 
worked into the story. Not sure how useful it will but it certainly makes it all more lively. 

Let's take... a lyric from a Childish Gambino song that I like because 
it references social media: "Come back to me like hipsters to blogspot" 

And it works... that was good. 

One more social media reference from the same great song: "Read your 
twitter messages, too proud to block you"

Good for texture and punchlines.
