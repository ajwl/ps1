Found this initiative interesting. Story is from a while ago, but law will be coming into force from April 2013.

Profits directly attributable to patents owned or wholly-licensed by a business will be taxed at 10% not 23% - the new corporation tax rate.

[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/09/patent_box_tax_cut_impact_on_business/)

So patent anything you damn well can.
